# Water Simulator!

A simple 2D watersim written in C++ using Raylib, ImGui, and Cmake!\
**UNFINISHED!!!**

**Build instructions: Windows & Linux**
 - Install Cmake if you haven't already (On Windows install Visual Studio 2022 and make sure C++ debugging is setup)
 - Clone or Download the repository
 - Open a new terminal instance in root directory
 - Run the following commands:

**Linux:**\
`mkdir build`\
`cd build`\
`cmake ..`\
`cmake --build .`

You're good to go!

**Windows:**\
`md build`\
`cd build`\
`cmake ..`\
`cmake --build .`

**The Windows version will compile as a Visual Studio Solution file**, you need to **open it**, **right click on WaterSim and set it as the StartUp Project**.
Once that's done, go to the **top of the window and press play!** If you need, you can change the build option to release (debug or release both work).
You can build the project with different options but this is the most consistent 

You'll find the built file in the build directory (If it's not there check in the debug, X64, or Releases folder)

**Build Instructions: Mac**\
...Hope and pray? I don't have XCode or a Mac to test this on

As of the Initial Commit there are no external dependencies, the file path of the final executable
is completely arbitary

That's it!\
As always, made with ❤️ (and the occasional prayer to Zagroth, the god of compilers)\
