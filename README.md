# Water Simulator!

A simple 2D watersim written in C++ using Raylib, ImGui, and Cmake!\
**UNFINISHED!!!**

**Build instructions: Windows & Linux**
 - Install Cmake if you haven't already
 - Clone or Download the repository
 - Open a new terminal instance in root directory
 - Run the following commands:

`mkdir build`\
`cd build`\
`cmake ..`\
`cmake --build .`

You'll find the built file in the build directory (If it's not there check in the debug folder)

**Build Instructions: Mac**\
...Hope and pray?

As of the Initial Commit there are no external dependencies, the file path of the final executable
is completely arbitary

That's it!\
As always, made with ❤️ (and the occasional prayer to Zagroth, the god of compilers)\
